This program allows you to create a PDF file of a certificate of completion
of a language school indicating the studentâ€™s name, surname, level of study,
course name, number of school hours and year of study period.
The program works with English. The certificate itself is attached by the
user to the directory structure of the program and should be called Cert.jpg.
